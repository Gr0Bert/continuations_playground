There is no need in the article on IO, because of this beautiful talk:    
[Fabio Labellaâ€”How do Fibers Work? A Peek Under the Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5_MmZVLiSM)
and [examples from his slides](https://github.com/SystemFw/Scala-World-2019/blob/master/Examples.scala)        
Inspired by talk I wrote my small toy version of IO:  
[AsyncIO.scala](continuations_playground/src/main/scala/concurrency/AsyncIO.scala)
